The project combined field recordings, music composition, sound therapy, and groundbreaking technology in a custom-designed listening room. Participants were exposed to 10-minute sessions of silence, city noise, and Swell Sound Treatment, while mobile EEG and biosensors measured brainwaves and heart rates. Surveys provided insights into relaxation and reconnection to the natural world.",
