            "text": "Sensate developed a pebble-shaped device that delivers infrasonic resonance when paired with custom soundscapes, aiming to promote deep relaxation through vagal toning and bone conduction. The objective was to validate the combined effect of the device's sound and vibration features on user wellbeing.",

Phase two had participants integrate Sensate into their daily routines for three weeks, with groups using the device with soundscapes, soundscapes only, or a control rest condition.",

            "text": "EEG analysis revealed that using Sensate induced whole-brain synchronization, a state associated with deep meditation. Over the three-week period, participants developed a daily ritual that supported stress reduction and mood improvement, with the Sensate soundscapes proving particularly effective.",
